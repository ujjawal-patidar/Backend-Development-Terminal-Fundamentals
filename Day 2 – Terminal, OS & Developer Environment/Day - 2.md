**Linux basics**

Linux operating systems are based on the Linux kernel. A Linux-based operating system will consist of Linux kernel, GUI/CLI, system libraries and system utilities.

A kernel is the most important part of an operating system—it performs important functions like process management, memory management, filesystem management, etc.

Linux is a kernel and not a complete operating system. Linux kernel is combined with GNU system to make a complete operating system

 Therefore, Linux-based operating systems are also called as GNU/Linux systems. GNU is an extensive collection of free softwares like compiler, debugger, C library etc


**popular Linux distributions**
 A Linux distribution (distro) is an operating system based on the Linux kernel and a package management system. Packages are installed and managed in the operating system by a package manager.

*List of popular Linux distributions:*

**Shell vs Terminal**
Shell is a program that takes commands from the users and gives them to the operating system for processing. Shell is an example of a CLI (command line interface). Bash is one of the most popular shell programs available on Linux servers. Other popular shell programs are zsh, ksh and tcsh.

Terminal is a program that opens a window and lets you interact with the shell. Some popular examples of terminals are GNOME-terminal, xterm, Konsole, etc.

**user calls and system calls**
user call are the calls which we give to the appliation which than intract with the kernel like (cd) which is readed by the shell and then it converts it into chdir() which is the system call to kernel

System call are the call which are used to directly intract with the kernel
